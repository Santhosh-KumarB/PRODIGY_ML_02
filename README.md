# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship (Task-02)**.

The objective of this task is to segment customers of a retail store into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior using **K-Means clustering**.

---

## 📌 Task Objective
To group customers into distinct segments based on:
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

This helps businesses understand customer behavior and design better marketing strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset
Customer Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle – Mall Customers)

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Loaded and explored the customer dataset
2. Selected relevant features for clustering
3. Used the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
4. Applied **K-Means clustering**
5. Visualized customer segments using scatter plots

---

## ✅ Results
The model successfully grouped customers into multiple clusters based on income and spending behavior, providing clear insights into customer segmentation.

## 🔥 Extra Showcase 

In addition to the notebook implementation, this project is also developed as a **Flask-based web application** using VS Code.

The web app allows users to:
- Enter Annual Income and Spending Score
- Predict the customer segment using a trained K-Means model
- View results through an interactive UI
